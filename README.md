# tensorflow-fcwta

TensorFlow implementation of a **fully-connected winner-take-all (FC-WTA) autoencoder**,
as described in ["Winner-Take-All Autoencoders"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.2752.pdf) (2015) by Alireza Makhzani and Brendan Frey
at the University of Toronto.

This is a work in progress.

## Credits

The code for enforcing lifetime sparsity is based on the implementation at [iwyoo/tf_ConvWTA](https://github.com/iwyoo/tf_ConvWTA).
